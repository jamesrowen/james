My personal website. WIP. Hand-written HTML/CSS/JS/jQuery, with inspiration and bits of code from various places.

Contains a static node.js server. Run "node app.js" from the project root directory, browse to localhost:8888.


Selected todos:
* make it responsive
* make a (slider?) setting for text contrast
* add a spinny plus/minus thing to the projects drop down
* use cookie to remember settings (snd js to activate the settings)
