					An LED installation with a custom-made controller. Knobs and buttons allow the user to
          choose and modulate different patterns.

          In the video I attempt to demonstrate the controller, and largely fail. The project
          has since been rendered inoperable, so it's the best we've got.

					I hastily scrapped this together with materials I had on-hand shortly before an event.
          I had originally started work on the controller for the <a href="/tri-pxl">tri pxl</a> project,
          but I didn't have any modules in working condition.
				</p>
				<p>
					The tri pxl code was designed around the concept of <b>Rows</b>. Each concentric triangle
          is modeled as a Row. The number of Rows and their lengths are configurable, and the patterns
          use an API to operate on the rows, making the system adaptable to displays of any shape that
          could be interpreted as a series of rows (in theory).
				</p>
        <p>
          With zigzag I wanted to test that hypothesis, so I created a shape with rows that are linear
          rather than circular. I also moved from the Arduino to the Teensy, for more pins and
          memory in a small footprint.
        </p>
        <p>
          Overall it worked pretty well; the code and controller worked without much fuss. The nature
          of the zigzag is that each row alternates direction, which looks good with some patterns but
          not others, so I added an option to flip every other row.
        </p>
        <p>
          For some reason I decided to use two Teensys â€“ one to handle the knobs and buttons,
          and one to run the LEDs. To send the input state from one to the other, I ended up connecting
          them by their Serial ports, which meant writing a (very rudimentary) byte-level protocol.
        </p>
        <p>
          That was kind of exciting because I've rarely worked at that level, but it ended up being
          flaky and would frequently become disconnected or garbled. In the future I would
          try to fit everything on a single board.
