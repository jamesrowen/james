					This was my first project with individually addressable LEDs, also known as pixels or
          NeoPixels. A friend had sent me
          <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90oZ52M4IC0">this video</a>
          of the "Johnson Family Dubstep Christmas Light Show,"
          and I was pretty impressed. Matt Johnson is a talented professional and has
          <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLOp9Tx63j4ojLndg_GsMVdVZSh_ALLiDf">
            some excellent videos
          </a>
          detailing how his installations are made. Feeling inspired, I bought an Arduino Uno,
          a soldering iron, and some LEDs.
				</p>
        <p>
          I liked how the pixels could be used to form any shape, and I immediately wanted
          to make a triangle. It's a highly versatile shape, and I thought it would be fun to program
          different patterns for it, so I put together a prototype.
        </p>
        <p>
          Liking how it turned out, I set out to build two larger modules out of plywood. I measured,
          marked out, and drilled 252 holes for each. Later versions would be cut from steel on a
          waterjet and powder-coated.
        </p>
        <p>
          I used the "bullet" type LEDs – their individual cases and flexible connections make them
          well-suited to fit snugly in the holes (though without glue they can be pushed out under rough
          or dusty conditions). I then glued on side walls and attached a back cover with hinges,
          resulting in two nicely contained modules.
        </p>
        <p>
          With the build complete, I was ready to move on to the software. This is the most exciting part,
          where you really get to see what kind of ideas you can come up with and express
          mathematically. My system works on the concept of <b>patterns</b>,
          where each pattern is a function that takes in a "progress" amount (from 0-100%) and sets the
          color of each pixel. Each pattern defines how to make use of <b>parameters</b> that can alter it,
          for example the color or number of colors. Four patterns are shown in the video above, but
          there are countless more possibilities.
        </p>
        <p>
          Once you start adding in knobs and buttons, it gets really fun. If, for example, you're wondering
          how many segments to use in a pattern, or how big the segments should be, or how many
          colors they should use – you can easily hook those parameters up to knobs and simply try them
          out in different combinations.
        </p>
        <p>
          It feels like creating an instrument and learning how to play it
          at the same time. And when you find some good combinations, you create a sequencing system
          so it can gradually morph between them, playing back your written compositions.
