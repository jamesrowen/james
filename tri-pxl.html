				This was my first project with individually addressable LEDs, also known as pixels or
        NeoPixels. A friend had sent me a video of the
        <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90oZ52M4IC0">Johnson Family Dubstep Christmas Light Show</a>,
        and I was pretty impressed. Digging deeper, I learned that Matt Johnson is a talented
        professional with
        <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLOp9Tx63j4ojLndg_GsMVdVZSh_ALLiDf">
          some excellent videos
        </a>
        detailing some of his process. Feeling inspired, I bought an Arduino Uno,
        a soldering iron, and some LEDs.
			</p>
      <p>
        I liked how the pixels could be used to form any shape, and I immediately wanted
        to make a triangle. It's a highly versatile shape, and I thought it would be fun to program
        different patterns for it, so I put together a prototype.
      </p>
      <p>
        Liking how it turned out, I set out to build two larger modules out of plywood. I measured,
        marked out, and drilled 252 holes for each. Later versions would be cut from steel on a
        waterjet and powder-coated. I then glued on side walls and attached hinged back covers.
      </p>
      <p>
        I used the "bullet" type LEDs – their individual casings and flexible connections make them
        well-suited to being fit snugly in the holes (though even wwith glue they can be pushed out
        under rough or dusty conditions). After inserting them I mounted a
        power supply and microcontroller inside each box and wired everything up, resulting in two nicely
        contained modules with only power cords sticking out.
      </p>
      <p>
        With the build complete, I was ready to focus on the software. This is the exciting part,
        where you really get to see what kind of ideas you can come up with and express
        mathematically. The software is based on the concept of <b>patterns</b>,
        where a pattern is a function that takes in a "progress" amount (from 0-100%) and sets the
        color of each pixel. Each pattern defines how to make use of <b>parameters</b> that can alter it,
        for example the color or number of colors. Four patterns are shown in the video, but
        there are countless more possibilities.
      </p>
      <p>
        Microcontrollers make it easy to add knobs and buttons, which is where it starts to get really
        fun. If you're wondering how many segments to use in a pattern, or how big the segments should
        be, or what colors they should use – you can hook those parameters up to knobs and simply try
        them out in different combinations.
      </p>
      <p>
        It started to feel like simultaneously creating an instrument and learning how to play it. Once
        I started getting the hang of it, finding good looking configurations, the next logical
        step was to create a sequencing system that gradually changes the parameters while looping
        the patterns, effectively playing back written compositions.
