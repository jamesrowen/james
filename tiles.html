					<a href="/tiles">Tiles</a> is an interactive browser-based visualization made with
          <a href="https://p5js.org">p5.js</a>. Three distinct modes explore the striking visual effects
          of a grid of rotating symmetrical tiles. A variety of tools allow the user to shape
          the animation in exciting ways.
				</p>
				<p>
					Each mode contains a number of <b>presets</b> that demonstrate some of the possibilities.
          I recommend clicking through them!

				While browsing the clearance section at Ikea, I came across a rack of ceramic tiles
        with various designs. The simple symmetry of one design in particular intrigued me,
        so I bought a few boxes.
			</p>
			<p>
				Back at home I started arranging the tiles on a table, and found that there were indeed many
        interesting patterns to explore. But how then could I choose just one configuration to permanently
        fix them in? I envisioned a large wall of motorized tiles, each rotating independently, capable of
        rearranging itself into any pattern.
			</p>
			<p>
				I would still like to build this project, but in the interim I settled for the next best thing
        - simulating it in software. This is the <b>pattern</b> mode in tiles, described below.
      </p>
			<p>
				The effect was mesmerizing, and I began adding modes and features to explore the depth of patterns
        and effects emerging from the simple concept.

				Even before I had the grid rendering on the screen, I wondered "What if each tile was just
        spinning faster than the one before it, forever?" Turned out to be pretty cool, and thus the
        <b>spin</b> mode was born. The many different ratios produce an evolving flow with patterns
        forming and disintegrating amongst the chaos.
			</p>
			<p>
				Turning the <b>curve</b> parameter all the way down reduces the composition to straight
        lines only, while retaining the organic flowing motion.
			</p>
			<p>
				The first tile does not move at all. I later learned that
        <a href="https://www.arthurganson.com">Arthur Ganson</a>
        had (among others) explored this concept beautifully with
        <a href="https://www.arthurganson.com/concrete-1">Machine With Concrete</a>.

      <p>
        In <b>pattern</b> mode, the grid transitions between a set of defined patterns. A pattern is
        a function that assigns one of four directions to each tile in the grid. Most of them are
        quite simple algebraic expressions (they can be viewed
        <a href="https://github.com/jamesrowen/tiles/blob/master/patterns.js">here</a>).
        It's a fun logic puzzle trying to convert a pattern in your head or on the
        table into function. Testing random formulas and tweaks just to see what happens is also fun.
      </p>
      <p>
        Transitions consist of rotating the tiles that need to be changed from one pattern to the next.
        Transition functions tell each tile when during the transition to start rotating, creating
        different wipe effects. Multiple transitions can be in effect simultaneously.
			</p>
			<p>
				The tiles rotate clockwise by default. This creates a rolling effect that makes it easy to follow
        the transition. When the <b>short</b> button is enabled, tiles that would rotate 270° will instead
        rotate 90° the other direction. This creates more of an organic morphing effect.
			</p>
			<p>
				As of December 2020 there are 19 patterns (chosen in a randomized sequence) and 8 transitions.
        Countless more possibilities exist, adding pre-calculated "bitmaps" and ultimately "videos"
        would be a logical next step.

				<b>Orbit</b> mode was discovered entirely by accident, due to a bug in the tile rotation code.
        When first entering this mode, it displays what I saw when it first happened.
        Expecting to see the familiar grid, I was instead greeted by a curled worm-like shape, unfolding
        ominously as various celestial objects zoomed by on wild orbits. Completely bewildered, I burst into
        laughter.
			</p>
			<p>
        As the worm flattens out, the grid does make a brief appearance before flying off
        into orbit again, providing a clue as to what is going on. In many drawing contexts, in order
        to rotate an object, you move the "camera" to the center of the object, rotate the camera,
        draw the object, and then return the camera to its starting position before drawing the next object.
        I had forgotten that last step, which resulted in the camera movements compounding on each other.
			</p>
      <p>
        The bug was fixed, but the mode was kept. As I dug deeper I learned how to navigate it,
        developed tools to manipulate it, and discovered more interesting phenomena (some can be seen
        in the mode's presets). It felt like exploring a microcosm of creatures under a microscope.
