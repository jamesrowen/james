					<a href="/tiles">Tiles</a> is an interactive visualization made with <a href="https://p5js.org">p5.js</a>.
					A single tile is drawn repeatedly. By changing the orientation of the tile, many patterns emerge.
				</p>
				<p>
					Three different modes are available, each exploring a different concept and UI with the same set of tiles.

				While browsing the Ikea clearance section, I came across some boxes of ceramic tiles in a few different
				designs. One design interested me due to its symmetry, so I bought a couple boxes.
			</p>
			<p>
				When I got home and laid them out on the table, I found that there were indeed many interesting patterns
				to explore. But how could I choose just one to permanently affix them in? I envisioned a
				large wall of tiles, each connected to a motor, allowing them to rotate freely to form any pattern.
			</p>
			<p>
				I still would like to build this project, but in the interim I settled for the next best thing - simulating
				it in software. This is the <b>pattern</b> mode in tiles. Each pattern is a function that assigns an orientation
				to each tile (up, right, down, or left, represented as 0, 1, 2, 3).
			</p>
			<p>
				Transitions between patterns are then defined by simply rotating each tile from its orientation in pattern A to
				its orientation in pattern B. Transition functions return a value from 0 to 1 for each tile, which determines the
				point during the transition when it should start to rotate. Multiple transitions can be in effect simultaneously.
			</p>
			<p>
				As of Dec 2020 I've created 19 patterns and 8 transitions, which can be viewed <a href="https://github.com/jamesrowen/tiles/blob/master/patterns.js">here</a>.
				Most of them are pretty simple algebraic expressions, it's a fun puzzle trying to convert a pattern in your
				head or on the table into a function. Countless more possibilities exist, adding pre-calculated
				"bitmaps" and ultimately "videos" would be a logical next step.
			</p>
			<p>
				By default, all tiles rotate clockwise. This creates a smooth effect that makes it easy to "follow" the transition.
				When the <b>short</b> button is enabled, tiles that would rotate 270° will instead rotate 90° the other direction.
				This creates a more "magic-like" effect where the patterns cohere and decohere.
			</p>
			<p>
				Eventually features were added that went beyond reasonable physical capabilities, such as overlapping transparent
				tiles and three-dimensional flipping. It's been a lot of fun to build and I and continue to be mesmerized by
				the depth of organic motion emerging from such simple math.

				The <b>spin</b> mode was created to answer the question "what would it look like if each tile was spinning
				faster than the one before it?" Turned out it was pretty cool. All the different ratios produce
				an ever-evolving flow where brief glimpses of structure form and dissipate amongst the chaos.
			</p>
			<p>
				The animation is fully deterministic (no randomness) and can theoretically run forever without repeat.
			</p>
			<p>
				The first tile never moves at all. I later learned of Arthur Ganson's wonderful
				<a href="https://www.arthurganson.com/concrete-1">Machine With Concrete</a>, which explores a similar concept.
