					Vrony is a program written in <a href="https://processing.org">Processing</a> for exploring animated
					Voronoi diagrams. It contains a control panel with a number of sliders and buttons for modifying the animation.
				</p>
				<p>
					One interesting feature is the sequencer, inspired by the music-making software <a href="https://www.ableton.com/en/live/">Ableton Live</a>.
					This allows the user to "automate" the parameters of the animation over time, to create complex long-running animations.
					The sequencer is designed such that it could be used with any Processing program, and it may be developed into a standalone library.

				A Voronoi diagram is created by taking a set of points and calculating the region of space closest to each point,
				resulting in a tesselation of polygons. I figured this would be a good candidate for creating interesting
				animations due to its simplicity and ease of manipulation.
			</p>
			<p>
				I would normally use the JavaScript port of Processing (<a href="https://p5js.org">p5.js</a>) for a browser-based
				experience, but for best performance I decided to go with the (Java-based) original. This unfortunately makes it more
				difficult for people to try out.
			</p>
			<p>
				I briefly researched the the various algorithms for generating the diagrams (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fortune%27s_algorithm">Fortune's algorithm</a>
				is an interesting one), but luckily I was able to find the
				<a href="https://leebyron.com/mesh/">Mesh</a> Processing library by <a href="https://leebyron.com/">Lee Byron</a>,
				which is based on the O(n log(n)) <a href="https://www.cs.ubc.ca/~lloyd/java/quickhull3d.html">QuickHull3D</a> algorithm.
			</p>
			<p>
				I also found a <a href="https://cs.uwaterloo.ca/~csk/publications/Papers/kaplan_1999.pdf">paper</a> from
				<a href="https://cs.uwaterloo.ca/~csk/">Craig S. Kaplan</a> at the University of Waterloo, exploring this topic
				as early as 1999. One of the modes in vrony was inspired by a description in this paper.

				The <b>mode</b> determines how the control points are arranged, how they move during the course of the animation,
				and which parameters affect their movement. Currently there are two modes, each with enough depth to create a wide
				range of effects, but there are many still to be explored.
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>
					In <b>mode 0</b>, the points are arranged in concentric circles, which can rotate in sync or in alternating directions.
					The circles can be "perturbed" or moved off-center, creating an off-kilter effect.
				</li>
				<li>
					In <b>mode 1</b>, the points are arranged in a circle of rings, with an additional "wheel" passing through the center of
					the rings. As the size of the rings grows, they overlap and form complex interlocking shapes.
				</li>
			</ul>
			<p>
				The <b>color mode</b>, along with <b>num colors</b>, determines the pattern for coloring the polygons. Simply changing
				these settings can have striking effects, highlighting different substructures within the overall shape.
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>
					In <b>color mode 0</b>, all polygons are colored, rotating through a palette of colors.
				</li>
				<li>
					In <b>color mode 1</b>, each ring has one color, alternating between the palette colors and black.
				</li>
				<li>
					In <b>color mode 2</b>, each ring has one color, but each polygon in the ring alternates between that color and black.
				</li>
			</ul>

				The <b>sequencer</b> is a proof-of-concept that needs some more work to be truly functional. Planned enhancements include:
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Saving and loading of sequence files.</li>
				<li>Scrollable list of sequence parameters.</li>
				<li>Adjusting the length of the sequence.</li>
				<li>A multi-shape LFO that could be added to any parameter.</li>
				<li>Video export.</li>
			</ul>
