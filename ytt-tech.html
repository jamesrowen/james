					<a href="https://ytt-tech.com">YTT Tech</a> is a collection of instructional YouTube videos.
					It invites the user to explore different subjects and dive into content. Some information about
					the tools and materials used in the videos is also provided.
				</p>
				<p>
					I love watching YouTube videos that teach you how to do something. Video is a great format
					for delivering instruction on many skills and processes that would otherwise require an in-person
					teacher. I had an idea to create a website dedicated to collecting and curating those videos.
				</p>
				<p>
					So far the surface has only been scratched, and many gaps remain to be filled. Users can register and
					submit videos to be added to the database. Additional authoring and management tools are available to
					Editor and Adminitrative users.
				</p>
				<p>
					One of the main challenges is determining the hierarchy of topics (currently organized into Departments
					containing Sections). This will have to be adapted as the collection grows. More search and filtering
					capabilities will become useful.

					Made with React (Hooks), Styled Components, AWS Lambda/SAM, DynamoDB, S3, Cognito, Amplify, Route53.
