			<a href="https://ytt-tech.com">YTT Tech</a> is a curated database of
      instructional YouTube videos, with an inviting interface that encourages the user to explore a
      catalog of skills and dive into quality content. Supplemental information about the tools
      and materials used is also provided.
		</p>
		<p>
			It's made with React, Styled Components, AWS Lambda/SAM, and DynamoDB.

			It's amazing how much instructional content is available to us on YouTube. It's empowering,
      really, that we can instantly look up how to do so many things. Video is a great format
			for learning many skills and techniques that might otherwise require in-person
			instruction. When I looked around for a site dedicated to organizing and curating
      this content, I didn't find much, so I decided to make one.
		</p>
		<p>
			After implementing the basic experience and authoring tools I spent weeks combing through
      videos to get the collection started, and I've only scratched the surface. Many areas of interest
      remain to be included, and to that end, users can submit videos to the database. If the
      idea resonates it could grow into a useful resource.

        The main interface, called the Explorer, was designed to encourage browsing and discovery.
        Considerable screen space is given to the department and section lists that might otherwise
        be implemented as dropdowns. This allows the user see the options and
        quickly try them out.

        The tools window appears when clicking on a tool or material, providing additional information
        and resources.

        Users can submit videos and suggest changes to other videos and tools/materials.

        Submitted videos are reviewed by Editors before being activated. Editors can edit videos
        and tools/materials, and add departments and sections.

			One of the major challenges is determining a sensible hierarchy of departments and
      sections, and placing videos within them. Ultimately subjective judgment calls will have to
      be made, and the list will adapt and respond to the growth of the database. More search and
      filtering capabilities will become necessary, and potentially a third level of hierarchy.
